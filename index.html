									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>I was born and raised in Manhattan Beach, California, a small, beachy suburb of Los Angeles. From a young age, I have loved going to the beach and being outside. I also am passionate about music. At Cornell, I play trombone in the Pep Band and Marching Band and over the summer I play euphonium with Pacific Crest Drum and Bugle Corps. I like dogs and convincing people to have a plant-based diet.</p>

									<h3>Northrop Grumman Corporation</h3>
									<p>During the Summer of 2018, I interned at the Northrop Grumman Corporation in Redondo Beach, CA. As an intern, I worked with metrology engineers and learned how to perform manual and automated calibrations for lab equipment such as oscilloscopes, power supplies, and digital multimeters. I also learned how to calibrate  AC/DC standard references with metrology engineers in addition to performing virus scans, sanitization and imaging on DC/LF and Radio Frequency measurement and test equipment. At the end of my internship, I led a team of 4 interns to develop a poster and presentation on metrology and its role in the company for the Northrop Grumman Explore Aerospace Poster Competition. </p>
